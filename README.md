# ðŸ§  Data Mining Project â€“ Heart Disease Analysis

This project applies **data mining techniques** to a heart disease dataset.  
It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling to better understand factors influencing heart disease.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- **HW1.ipynb** â†’ Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and code  
- **heart.csv** â†’ Dataset used in the project  
- **index.html** â†’ Rendered HTML report (viewable on GitHub Pages)  
- **README.md** â†’ Project documentation  

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** â€“ visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**, **Statsmodels** â€“ machine learning and analysis

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps
1. Load and preprocess dataset (`heart.csv`)  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
   - Distribution plots  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Feature exploration  
3. Build and evaluate predictive models for heart disease classification  
4. Summarize results in a structured report (`index.html`)  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Identified important correlations between patient features and heart disease risk  
- Built a classification model with solid performance metrics  
- Produced clear visualizations and an interactive HTML report  

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Add more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy  
- Deploy the predictive model as a web/mobile app for healthcare use cases
